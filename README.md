# High-frequency_sub-pixel_vibration_measurement_based_on_compressed_sensing

## Requirements
Matlab 2022b or newer. Older visions may be sufficient but have not been tested.

Install the CVX toolbox. CVX Home Page: http://cvxr.com/cvx/  or you can click [here](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/) to download the toolbox.

## Quick Start
- **Run [`main.m`](https://github.com/lixingjian-official/High-speed-camera-measurement-based-on-compressed-sensing_upload/blob/master/main.m) with default parameters.**
- **Select the data folder and see how it works.**
- **Try on your own experiment data.**
